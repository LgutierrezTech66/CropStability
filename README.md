# CropStability
ML Model to predict Crop Stability for Onion, Garlic and Parsley.

Goal:

Creating a machine learning model that predicts whether a crop is stable or unstable based on factors like rainfall, temperature, soil PH, and crop type, and presenting via a streamlit web interface.

Training and Saving the Model:
Libraries: 
* Pandas: for handling data
* sklearn: for training the model
* pickle: for saving/loading the model
* os: ensures the model folder exists
